# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Synopsis
This project covers:
* Whatâ€™s an interactive test
* Why tests are important
* How to write Docstrings to create tests
* How to write documentation for each module and function
* What are the basic option flags to create tests
* How to find edge cases

## Requirements for Python scripts
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* All files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7.*)
* All files must be executalbe
* All modules should have documentation
* Code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`)

## Requirements for Python test cases
* All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
* All your test files should be text files
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
* All your modules and functions should have a documentation

## Environment
The project was tested and compiled on `Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty64)` via Vagrant run through VirtualBox.

## File Descriptions
This repository contains the following files. Listed are the parameters of each task:

### 0-add_integer.py

Write a function that adds 2 integers.

* Prototype: `def add_integer(a, b=98):`
* `a` and `b` must be integers or floats, otherwise raise a `TypeError` exception with the message `a must be an integer` or `b must be an integer`
* `a` and `b` must be first casted to integers if they are float
* Returns an integer: the addition of `a` and `b`
* You are not allowed to import any module

### tests/0-add_integer.txt

Test file

### 2-matrix_divided.py

Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.

* Prototype: `def matrix_divided(matrix, div):`
* `matrix` must be a list of lists of integers or floats, otherwise raise a `TypeError` exception with the message `matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats`
*
